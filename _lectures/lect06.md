## Prep before class

* Bring your laptops to class
* Read this programming assignment: [https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/lab/lab06/](https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/lab/lab06/)
* Clone the starter code for the assignment from this git repo: [https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-w18/cs16-w18-starter-code](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-w18/cs16-w18-starter-code)
* Link to [collaborative notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/105r76luP6qwW_AKhCZPeVL7nQjCd2Ctoe4-nAytR-mk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Tips for assisting students with programming assignments

* During class we will go over the tips in [this handout](http://csteachingtips.org/tips-for-tutors)

* We will practice the tips in the handout by applying them to one of the lab assignments in CS16 : [https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/lab/lab06/](https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/lab/lab06/). 

* Our main focus will be on strategies to help students who don't know how to start or need assistance with code that doesn't work. 

## Activity: 

* Read the assignment writeup. Put yourself in the shoe of a student who has read the writeup of the lab but doesn't know how to start. Now articulate a question specific to the lab that begins with "I don't know how to start ...." try to fill in the blank.  You could ask I don't know how to start this lab, but try to make it more realistic in the context of the lab. For example "I don't know how to start compiling my code" or "I don't know which file to start with" or I don't know how to start implementing the function addIntToEndOfList". 

* Read the tips under the section "If they don't know how to get started". Now assume the role of a tutor and formulate a response that applies one or more of these tips as appropriate. Have a brief interaction with the "student" 

* Take the interaction further: Form pairs where one person assumes the role of the student and another that of the tutor. Student pick a "I don't know to start ..." question. Tutor help the student get started by using one of these tips or some other strategy that you have found effective. Do this for 5 minutes. Then have a discussion about your strategy and whether you think it was effective.
