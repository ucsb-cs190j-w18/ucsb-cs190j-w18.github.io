Teaching-track faculty contribute in the following key areas of teaching, service and research and faculty are reponsible to keep track of their contributions. In this class you are asked to do something similar.

On gauchospace, create a log of your weekly contributions to

* Research: These are your findings from reading research Ed papers, and thoughts on experiments that we can run in our classes

* Service: These are initiatives that you have taken outside of prescribed work
