# Code Review

* Short Code Review Checklist: <https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/pcr/sigcse2014/asDeliveredAtSIGCSE/example-code-review-checklist.pdf>


* Article: "Coding Guidelines: Finding the Art in the Science"

    There are two different versions; same content, just formatted differently:
    * In ACM Queue: [main page with link to html and pdf](https://doi.org/10.1145/2063166.2063168)
    * In CACM: [main page with link to html and pdf](https://doi.org/10.1145/2043174.2043191), 

    Here is is the [Coding Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRH16gw4r6lCFJbG6W_7Fro2oD0WjSEKQmEJMNCvHdREF7L5fSCvskAynHbPuZfE2F-fPh2wArDoRp9/pub) that are referred to in that article, formatted a little cleaner than the original.
